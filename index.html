        <p><li>I came across a union bank robotics program online  I registered for it and they told me to say a 1 minute video I did and I was selected. Few days later I was told that I am going to have a zoom meeting with the association of the awarri robotics legend and I was interview and they asked me a couple of question which I was able to answer them, they were so surprise that I am the only one from Oju. I was so scared whether I am going to be choosing, few days later I check my email and saw that I was choosing I was so excited and I went to Union Bank to collect my "ROBOT and IPAD"</li></p>
        <p><li>My mother was in lagos when she opened her facebook page and so a coding program she called me and told me about it. She told me that I am going have a free trial class with them and I did it. Later on I was given an award been among the top ten of the smartest computer literate and I was so happy. So I was selected and they told me that I am going to have my first class very soon. An I started with the association of "BRIGHTCHAMPS" on CODING</li></p>
